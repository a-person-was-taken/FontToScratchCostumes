# FontToScratchCostumes
Convert Fonts to Scratch Costumes

Many thanks to RexScratch's Stamp Font Engine Font Injector for the original project
I have adapted his work for use with generic Scratch Projects & Sprites

Try it out here: https://a-person-was-taken.github.io/FontToScratchCostumes/

The only change I made was to allow for multiple fonts in the same sprite (by appending the font name before the letter)
